Hello world!

I'm a Data Platform Engineer at Stitch Fix, helping to build and maintain our innovative experimentation platform. Recently I developed [mab](https://github.com/stitchfix/mab), a production-ready open-source library for multi-armed bandit selection strategies. Previously I worked as a data scientist, delivering high-value Machine Learning projects and solving challenging data problems across a range of complex domains. I have a PhD in experimental particle physics from UC Berkeley, where I analyzed huge datasets from the Large Hadron Collider in search of supersymmetry and microscopic black holes (I never found any).
