I'm a Data Platform Engineer at Stitch Fix, helping to build and maintain our innovative experimentation platform. Recently I developed [Mab](https://github.com/stitchfix/mab), a production-ready open-source library for multi-armed bandit selection strategies. You can find a live demo of the library at the end of [the talk](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/ai-superstream-series/0636920541356/0636920541356-video333183) I gave at O'Reilly Superstream: AI & ML in Production. You can also find out more about the Stitch Fix experimentation platform and multi-armed bandits in [the blog post](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/08/05/bandits/) I wrote for the Stitch Fix Multithreaded blog.

Previously I worked as a data scientist, delivering high-value Machine Learning projects and solving challenging data problems across a range of complex domains. I have a PhD in experimental particle physics from UC Berkeley, where I analyzed huge datasets from the Large Hadron Collider in search of supersymmetry and microscopic black holes (I never found any).
